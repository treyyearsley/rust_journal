# Overview

I wrote two different programs in Rust to get more practice. The other program is stored in a seperate repository. I wrote a journal program that allows the user to read and 
write to and from a text file. This program allowed me to practice using mutable variables as well as libraries for the Rust langauge. My purpose for writing this program was to 
learn and practice the basics of the Rust langauge and give me a foundation for the future.

# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code to develope these programs. I downloaded rust using rustup. Rustup will download all the necessary tool to code in the Rust langauge. I also used the
following libraries use std::fs::File;, use std::io::Write;, use std::io::Read;, and use std::io;. The librbaries allowed me to read froma nd write to a text file.

# Future Work

- Allow the user more options such as revising an entry.
- Allow the user to search entires by date.
- Allow the user to add a topic to their journal entry.
